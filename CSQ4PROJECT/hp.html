    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our website, which is committed to preserving and protecting aquatic 
      species and their environments. Our purpose is to raise awareness about the urgent
       challenges to marine life and to organize collective action to protect the long-term 
       well-being of our ocean and freshwater ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>Aquatic species are essential to the health of our world. They perform critical roles in preserving
       the balance of nature, biodiversity, and human livelihoods. However, human actions such as pollution, 
       overfishing, climate change, and habitat degradation are putting these species at risk. That is why we must help
       our ocean friends.
